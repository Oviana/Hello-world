introduction to github

Finally i am getting myselft introduced to github. The sole purpose of me being here i would like to have my projects or exercises problems to be on the cloud ( common place ) for me to access from anywhere. lets see where this journey takes me too. I am excited to be here and to have a lot of fun !
